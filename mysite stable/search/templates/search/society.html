        <h2>Who are we</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The Plant Protection Association of India (PPAI) is a scientific society for promoting the cause of the science of Plant Protection. The Society focuses on the field of Entomology, Plant Pathology, Nematology and management of weeds.It provides a unique platform to the scientists working in the field of plant protection-related research to share their research achievements. It also keeps members informed about the various activities related to the development of plant protection and about the members of the society.<br><br>
            The objectives of society include:
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                <li>To advance the cause of plant protection by encouraging and promoting plant protection research and education in the country.</li>
                <li>To provide a forum for dissemination of information related to plant protection through a journal.</li>
                <li>To bring about exchange of view and ideas of plant protection by organizing lectures, discussion, seminars, symposium etc.</li>
                <li>To maintain a link between plant protection workers in India.</li>
                <li>To facilitate closer association among members and other scientific workers in India and abroad.</li>
                <li>To involve in any such activity as will be useful for the advancement of adoption of plant protection.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
            The Plant Protection Association of India (PPAI) is a scientific society established in 1972. It is non-profit organization, registered under the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Public Societies Registration Act, 1350 Fasli (Act I of 1350 F.) on 4th December 1972. Its membership is open to all those scientists interested in promotion of plant protection and is dedicated for the cause. It operates from ICAR-National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, Regional Station, Hyderabad through an executive council and an editorial board duly elected once in two years.<br>
            The association publishes a scientific journal called the Indian Journal of Plant Protection (IJPP). Four issues of the journal are published every year in March, June, September, and December. So far 49 volumes have been published.

        <h2 id="second">Our Legacy</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Plant Protection Association of India (PPAI), since its inception in 1972, completed 50 years of yeoman
            service for the cause of Plant Protection both at National and International level. Dr K K Nirula was a
            founder-member and first President of Plant Protection Association of India. The Association’s present
            standing is entirely due to his untiring and dedicated efforts. The founder scientists of Central Plant
            Protection &amp; Training Institute (CPPTI) set the agenda for PPAI in 1972.</p>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <h2 id="third">Vision</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Indian agriculture registered a phenomenal growth in the recent past mainly due to development
            of varieties resistant to pathogen and adoption of latest plant protection measures. A lot more
            need to be done to sustain the momentum gained. In this context, the contribution of the Society
            in bringing to focus the area of research on diverse aspects of plant protection is invaluable. In
            these five decades, the field of crop protection has evolved from the basic idea of integrated pest
            control followed by integrated pest management into the present holistic concept of Plant Health
            Management (PHM). It has opened a new era in safeguarding agri-herticultural crops against the
            attack of arthropod pests, plant diseases and weeds for the benefit of farming community.<br> In this
            cause, PPAI has demonstrated its ability to bring to the fore the fruits of scientific research and
            facilitate all the concerned stakeholders by timely documentation through relevant publications
            including the internationally reputed ‘Indian Journal of Plant Protection’ and regular
            organization of several national and international conferences/seminars. This has enabled
            provision of timely and appropriate science platforms for deliberation, exchange and spread of
            the emerging knowledge in the areas of crop protection. However, in the near future the
            challenges of increasing human population, global climate change with its impact on agriculture
            and the relentless scientific conundrum of human made artificial intelligence, need urgent
            attention and redressal. The PPAI is working for diverse global community of scientists that
            provides credible and beneficial information related to plant protection; advocates and
            participates in the exchange of knowledge with public, policy makers, and the larger scientific
            community; and promotes and provides opportunities for scientific communication, career
            preparation and professional development for its members.</p>
